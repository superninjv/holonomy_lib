"""Benchmarks for holonomy_lib.topology.

Cases:
  - persistence_diagrams with reduction_backend="python" (CPython sets)
  - persistence_diagrams with reduction_backend="torch" (LongTensor cols)

The torch backend is NOT a custom CUDA kernel; it's a same-algorithm
port to torch ops so the reduction can stay on whatever device the
filtration lives on. For typical small inputs CPython sets are
competitive or faster (tight C ops). The crossover, if any, is at
sizes large enough that vectorized `unique` beats hashing — these
benchmarks measure that.
