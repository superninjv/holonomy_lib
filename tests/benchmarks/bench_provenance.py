"""Benchmarks for holonomy_lib.provenance overhead.

Per-call overhead of the @with_provenance decorator (inspect.signature,
content-hash, JSON canon) shows up on every primitive call inside a
record() context. We measure with a trivial op so the timing reflects
the decorator, not the op.

Three groups of cases:
1. Decorator overhead at small sizes — outside record, inside record,
   chained inside record. Establishes the per-call cost floor.
2. Hashing scale — recording an op whose input is a 2D float64 tensor
   from 16² (2 KB) up to 1024² (8 MB). Isolates the bytes-hash cost
   inside `_tensor_content_hex`; phase 1b sketch-hashing should crush
   this curve.
3. Cache + replay — `cache_tensors=True` overhead and replay vs
   direct-call cost. Phase 1c (disk cache) and phase 2a (replay
   completion) re-measure these.
