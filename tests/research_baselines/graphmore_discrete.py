"""GraphMoRE-style discrete-gating per-node curvature baseline.

A minimal implementation of the "pick one κ from a discrete set via
learned gating per node" pattern, used as the comparison baseline for
`HeterogeneousKappaManifold`'s continuous per-point κ in the C5 + C6
strengthening study.

This is **NOT a faithful reimplementation of GraphMoRE** (Guo et al.,
AAAI 2025, arXiv:2412.11085) — that paper has architectural choices
around mixture-of-experts attention, Riemannian routing, etc., that
are out of scope here. What we extract is the **interpretable
mechanism** we want to compare against: a discrete bank of K
curvature-experts, and a per-node soft gating that mixes their
distances.

The discrete-gating mechanism we implement:

  - Bank of K curvatures `κ_1, …, κ_K` (e.g. `{-1.0, 0.0, +0.5}`)
  - Per-node gating logits `g_i ∈ R^K` (learnable)
  - Soft assignment via softmax: `w_i = softmax(g_i)` ∈ Δ^{K-1}
  - For a pair (i, j), pair gating is `w_pair = (w_i + w_j) / 2`
    (the natural per-pair generalization of per-node soft gating)
  - Pair distance is the gating-weighted sum of constant-κ distances:
        d(x_i, x_j) = Σ_k w_pair[k] · d_{κ_k}(x_i, x_j)
    using each expert's `KappaStereographicManifold.distance`.

Why this mechanism is the right comparison:

  - **Mass per κ is a probability**: a node "is in expert k" with
    weight `w_i[k]`. Compared to our continuous κ, this is a
    coarse-grained representation — the model can only assign a
    probability over K fixed κ's, not a real number.
  - **Hard gating** (`argmax` instead of softmax) makes the
    assignment fully discrete; the K-many expert distance is just
    `d_{κ_k}(x_i, x_j)` where k is the chosen expert. We support
    both modes; soft is differentiable, hard is the literal
    "expert assignment" semantics.
