"""Sympy symbolic verification of the closed-form n=5 heat kernel.

Pseudo-verification for **C2** (research-claims catalog). The
implementation in `src/holonomy_lib/hyperbolic/heat_kernel.py:
_heat_kernel_unit_n5` uses the hand-derived polynomial form

    k^5_t(r) = (4πt)^(-5/2) · exp(-4t - r²/(4t))
                  · [r²·sinh r + 2t·(r·cosh r − sinh r)] / sinh³ r.

This script symbolically verifies that this expression:

  (A) is **algebraically equal** to the corrected operator-chain
      recursion applied once to k^3, and
  (B) **satisfies the H^5 radial heat equation**.

Both together pin the closed form as a correct, reference-quality
expression.
