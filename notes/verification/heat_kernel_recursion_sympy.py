"""Sympy symbolic verification of the hyperbolic-heat-kernel recursion.

Pseudo-verification for **C1** (research-claims catalog). Checks two
things symbolically:

1. **The corrected recursion identity**

       k^{n+2}(t, r) = -exp(-n·t) / (2π·sinh r) · ∂_r k^n(t, r)

   produces, when applied to the n=3 Davies–Mandouvalos closed form,
   a function that satisfies the H^5 radial heat equation
   `∂_t k − ∂_r² k − (n−1)·coth r · ∂_r k = 0`.

2. **The naive (incorrect) recursion**

       k^{n+2}_naive(t, r) = -1 / (2π·sinh r) · ∂_r k^n(t, r)

   does NOT satisfy the H^5 heat equation (the PDE residual is
   non-zero). This is the "implementation pitfall" the paper
   identifies.

We use sympy to expand the symbolic expressions, take derivatives,
and simplify the residual. If sympy can reduce the corrected
recursion's residual to 0 algebraically, and the naive one to a
non-zero expression, the bug-vs-fix story is symbolically locked
down.
