"""holonomy_lib.sheaf — cellular sheaves and sheaf Laplacians on graphs.

A **cellular sheaf** on a graph attaches a finite-dimensional vector
space (a "stalk") `F(σ)` to each simplex σ (node or edge) and a linear
**restriction map** `F_{τ ≤ σ}: F(τ) → F(σ)` for each face relation
τ ≤ σ. The sheaf is the data of those stalks + maps; the sheaf
Laplacian generalizes the graph Laplacian by capturing the
"disagreement" of node-stalk values once they are pushed up to each
incident edge stalk:

    L_F = δ^T δ,   δ_e(x)  =  F_{u ≤ e}(x_u) − F_{v ≤ e}(x_v)
                              for each edge e = (u, v).

When all stalks have dimension 1 and every restriction map is the
identity (i.e., the *trivial sheaf*), `L_F` reduces to the standard
combinatorial graph Laplacian. With higher-dimensional stalks and
non-trivial restriction maps it captures structure that a scalar
Laplacian cannot — orientation sheaves, signed cellular sheaves,
connection Laplacians, and the spectral domain that drives Neural
Sheaf Diffusion (Bodnar et al. 2022).

Currently exposed:
  GraphSheaf                  — dataclass holding edges + stalks + maps
  sheaf_coboundary(sheaf)     — δ as a (n_e·d_e, n_v·d_v) tensor
  sheaf_laplacian(sheaf)      — L_F = δ^T δ, (n_v·d_v, n_v·d_v), PSD
  sheaf_dirichlet_energy(sheaf, x)
                              — `x^T L_F x`, batched-first

Restricted to **node-edge sheaves on graphs** in v1; higher-dimensional
cellular sheaves on simplicial complexes (with 2-cells / faces and
the corresponding ∂_1 ∘ ∂_2 = 0 chain identity) is planned.
