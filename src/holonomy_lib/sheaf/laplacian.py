"""Sheaf coboundary, sheaf Laplacian, and Dirichlet energy on graphs.

The coboundary operator `δ: C^0 → C^1` sends a node-stalk vector
`x ∈ R^{n_v · d_v}` to an edge-stalk vector whose value at each edge
`e = (u, v)` is `F_left[e] · x_u − F_right[e] · x_v`. Stacked across
all edges, `δ` is an `(n_e · d_e) × (n_v · d_v)` matrix.

The sheaf Laplacian is `L_F = δ^T δ`, which is symmetric PSD by
construction. Its kernel is the space of **global sections**: tuples
of node-stalk values that all incident edges agree on under the
restriction maps. For the trivial sheaf this kernel is the constant
vectors (one per connected component) — exactly the kernel of the
combinatorial Laplacian.

Implementation: builds `δ` densely in v1. For a graph with `n_e`
edges, node-stalk dim `d_v`, edge-stalk dim `d_e`, this is a `(n_e
· d_e) × (n_v · d_v)` matrix — fine up to thousands of nodes; a
sparse path is a natural extension for large graphs.
