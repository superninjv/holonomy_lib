"""Ollivier-Ricci curvature on graphs, GPU-batched, Sinkhorn-based.

The Ollivier (2009) discrete Ricci curvature on a metric measure space
is defined for any two points x, y as

    κ(x, y)  =  1  −  W_1( μ_x , μ_y ) / d(x, y)

where d is the metric, μ_x and μ_y are probability measures attached
to x and y (typically lazy-random-walk distributions), and W_1 is the
Wasserstein-1 distance between them. For graphs we follow the standard
choices:

    d   = shortest-path distance (hop count for unweighted graphs;
          weight-respecting for weighted graphs assuming edge weights
          are interpreted as lengths)
    μ_x = (1−α) · u_x  +  α · δ_x
          where u_x is the (weight-normalized) distribution over x's
          neighbors and δ_x is the unit mass at x.

The parameter α ∈ [0, 1] is the "laziness" parameter. α = 0 gives the
original Ollivier (2009) curvature; α = 1 makes the walk completely
lazy (returns trivial 0 curvature); the limit α → 1 with appropriate
rescaling gives the Liu-Lin-Yau (2011) curvature, which is the most
common convention in network analysis.

The W_1 computation uses entropic Sinkhorn (Cuturi 2013) with cost
matrix equal to the shortest-path distance, which is well-suited for
GPU batching since each iteration is a pair of matrix-vector products.
Entropic regularization introduces a small bias; we expose `reg` so
callers can trade accuracy for stability.

Why this approximates Perelman's Ricci flow on networks:

  Perelman (2003) studied ∂g/∂t = −2 Ric(g) on Riemannian 3-manifolds.
  In the discrete setting, Sia-Jonckheere-Bogdan (2019) and Ni et al.
  (2019) show that iterating w_ij(t+1) = (1 − δt · κ_ij(t)) · w_ij(t)
  on edge weights with κ = Ollivier-Ricci leads to a network analog of
  Ricci flow, with negatively-curved edges getting elongated (analog
  of forming neckpinches) until "surgery" — edge removal — separates
  the graph into geometric pieces (the network analog of Thurston's
  geometric decomposition). This module provides the κ primitive; the
  flow and surgery operations are planned follow-ons.

    """Pairwise Ollivier-Ricci curvature on a (batched) weighted graph.

    Args:
      A: (B, n, n) symmetric weighted adjacency. Non-negative entries
        interpreted as edge weights (larger = stronger connection,
        shorter as a length in the shortest-path metric). Zero off-
        diagonal means no edge.
      alpha: laziness in [0, 1]. 0 is Ollivier's original convention;
        0.5 is a common "half lazy" choice in network analysis.
      reg: entropic-Sinkhorn regularization ε > 0. See module docstring.
      n_iter: maximum Sinkhorn iteration count.
      tol: Sinkhorn convergence tolerance — iteration stops early once
        the max-abs change in log_u across all pairs is below `tol`.
        With log-domain Sinkhorn at small `reg`, partial convergence
        can plateau for hundreds of iterations and only flip into the
        symmetric basin past some threshold; tol-based stopping lets
        easy cases finish fast while still allowing hard cases to run
        the full `n_iter` budget.
      tile_size: chunk the n² pairs into tiles of this size before
        running Sinkhorn. The peak memory cost of one Sinkhorn iter
        is O(B · tile_size · n²) bytes; the wall-clock cost is
        roughly constant in `tile_size` once the GPU is saturated.
        Default 256 keeps the inner broadcast under ~16 MB at n=256
        in float64. Smaller tiles → less memory + slightly more
        Python overhead; larger tiles → more memory + slightly less
        loop overhead.

    Returns:
      κ: (B, n, n) curvature tensor. κ[..., i, j] is the curvature
        between nodes i and j using the shortest-path metric. The
        diagonal κ[..., i, i] = 1 by convention (W_1(δ, δ) = 0 and
        d(x, x) = 0 — we set the diagonal to 1 to avoid 0/0).
        Pairs from different connected components have undefined
        geometric meaning; we return 0 there to keep the tensor finite.

    Shape note:
      The result is dense across all pairs, not just edges. To get
      edge-only curvatures, mask: `κ * (A > 0)`. Computing all pairs
      costs O(B · n³ · n_iter) for the Sinkhorn step plus O(B · n³)
      for shortest paths; for large n use a sparse/edge-only follow-on
      (planned).

    Disconnected components:
      Ollivier curvature has no standard definition between nodes in
      different components. We replace the +inf shortest-path distance
      with a large finite sentinel (DISCONNECTED_DISTANCE_MULTIPLIER ×
      max finite distance) so Sinkhorn stays numerically stable; the
      resulting κ for cross-component pairs is close to 1 (since the
      transport cost is dominated by the within-component support and
      thus small relative to the inflated d_G). These cross-component
      values are NOT geometrically meaningful — mask by `A > 0` (or by
      a connectivity mask) before interpreting κ. The Ricci-flow
      primitives in this module already do this internally, so the
      flow is unaffected; only direct consumers of the dense κ tensor
      need to filter.

        This matches Ni-Lin-Luo-Gao (2019)'s intent of "remove edges
        that have stretched far past their initial relative scale," but
        the practical sensitivity of the surgery is then conditioned on
