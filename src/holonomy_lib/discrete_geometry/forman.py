"""Forman-Ricci curvature on graphs, batched-first, GPU-native.

Forman (2003) defined a combinatorial Ricci curvature for general CW
complexes that specializes to a very simple per-edge formula on graphs.
Unlike Ollivier-Ricci (`ricci.ollivier_ricci_curvature`), no optimal-
transport solve is needed: each edge's curvature is a closed-form
function of the local degrees and (optionally) the triangles incident
to it. The cost is therefore O(B · |E|) for the simple form or
O(B · |E| · max_deg²) for the triangle-aware form, dramatically cheaper
than Sinkhorn-based Ollivier.

Forman-Ricci is less geometrically faithful than Ollivier on weighted
metric measure spaces, but it tracks the same qualitative bottleneck
structure: edges bridging two clusters get negative curvature, edges
embedded in dense sub-communities get positive curvature. For large
networks where Ollivier is infeasible, Forman-Ricci is the standard
substitute (Sreejith et al. 2016).

Cost note: the implementations here are O(B · n²) for the simple
form and O(B · n³) for the augmented form (the triangle-count
matmul). A future sparse path would be O(B · |E| · max_deg²) for
the augmented form; the dense path is fine up to n ~ 10⁴.

Two forms are exposed:

  forman_ricci_simple(A)
      κ_F(u, v) = w_e · ( w_u/w_e + w_v/w_e
                          - Σ_{e_u ≠ e} w_u/√(w_e · w_{e_u})
                          - Σ_{e_v ≠ e} w_v/√(w_e · w_{e_v}) )
      The original CW-complex specialization without 2-faces (Sreejith
      et al. 2016, eq. 1). On unweighted simple graphs with node
      weights = 1 this collapses to `4 - deg(u) - deg(v)`.

  forman_ricci_augmented(A)
      κ_F^aug(u, v) = κ_F_simple(u, v) + 3 · #triangles_through(u, v)
      Adds the contribution from 2-faces (triangles incident to the
      edge), restoring the "augmented" form that more closely tracks
      Ollivier-Ricci on dense substructures (Samal et al. 2018,
      §"Augmented Forman curvature").

    Implements the Sreejith et al. (2016) form without 2-face

      κ_F(u, v) = w_e · ( w_u/w_e + w_v/w_e

    For unweighted simple graphs (w_u = w_v = 1, w_e ∈ {0, 1}) this
    collapses to `4 - deg(u) - deg(v)`: positive on edges in sparse
    contexts (low degree), negative on edges anchored in dense hubs.

    Args:
      A: (B, n, n) symmetric weighted adjacency. Non-negative weights.
        Zero off-diagonal means no edge. Diagonal is ignored.

    Returns:
      κ_F: (B, n, n) curvature tensor. κ_F[..., u, v] is the Forman-
        Ricci curvature of edge (u, v) when A[..., u, v] > 0, and 0
        otherwise. The diagonal is set to 0 by convention (Forman is
        defined per edge, not per node-self-loop).

    Notes:
      Cost is O(B · n²) for the per-pair sums; for sparse graphs an
      edge-list variant (planned) would be O(B · |E|).
