"""Fréchet (Karcher) mean on a Riemannian manifold.

The Fréchet mean of a finite set of points `{p_1, …, p_N}` on a
manifold `M` with weights `w_i ≥ 0` is the point that minimizes the
weighted sum of squared geodesic distances:

    μ*  =  argmin_{μ ∈ M}  Σ_i w_i · d_M(μ, p_i)².

On a Hadamard manifold (simply connected, non-positive sectional
curvature — includes hyperbolic spaces of any negative curvature),
the objective is geodesically convex and the minimizer is unique.
Karcher (1977) showed that the gradient descent

    μ_{t+1}  =  exp_{μ_t}( Σ_i w_i · log_{μ_t}(p_i) / Σ_i w_i )

converges to `μ*` at a linear rate. The Riemannian gradient of
`d_M(μ, p)²` w.r.t. `μ` is `−2 · log_μ(p)`, so the inner sum is
exactly the gradient step direction (up to a factor of `2/Σ w_i`,
absorbed in the implicit step size `1`).

    """Karcher-iteration Fréchet mean of `points` on `manifold`.

    Args:
      points: `(B, N, ambient_dim)` — `N` points per batch on the
        manifold. For `LorentzManifold(n)`, `ambient_dim = n + 1`.
      manifold: object exposing `.log(x, y)`, `.exp(x, v)`,
        `.norm(x, v)` (e.g. `LorentzManifold`, `SPDManifold`).
      weights: optional `(B, N)` non-negative weights. If `None`,
        uniform weights `1/N` are used. Weights are normalized to sum
        to 1 along the `N` axis before use.
      max_iter: hard cap on Karcher iterations. Default 100 — a
        comfortable upper bound for the linear convergence rate on
        Hadamard manifolds; typical inputs reach `tol` in 5–30 steps.
      tol: stop when the Riemannian norm of the update tangent is
        below this floor across all batches. Default 1e-9 (the
        library's `numerical_floor_convention`).

    Returns:
      `(B, ambient_dim)` Fréchet mean per batch.

    Example:
      >>> from holonomy_lib.manifolds import LorentzManifold
      >>> mfd = LorentzManifold(n=3)
      >>> P = mfd.random_point(batch_size=10).unsqueeze(0)  # (1, 10, 4)
      >>> mu = frechet_mean(P, mfd)
      >>> mu.shape
      torch.Size([1, 4])

    Notes:
      Existence and uniqueness of the minimizer hold on Hadamard
      manifolds (Karcher 1977; Afsari 2011); hyperbolic spaces of any
      negative curvature are Hadamard, so this primitive is well-
      defined on `LorentzManifold` for all `k < 0` and on
      `KappaStereographicManifold(κ < 0)`.

      **Limitation on positive curvature.** For
      `KappaStereographicManifold(κ > 0)` (spherical) the manifold is
      NOT Hadamard — Karcher's convergence guarantee requires inputs
      lie within the injectivity radius `π/√κ` from each other. For
      well-spread spherical inputs the iteration may converge to a
      local optimum or fail to converge. The implementation runs
      unconditionally; the caller is responsible for checking the
      input spread.

      Per-batch convergence is checked against the **max** update norm
      across the batch, not each batch element separately — so a slow-
      converging element delays the loop for the whole batch. This is
      the standard cost of vectorized iterative algorithms.
