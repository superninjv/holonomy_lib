"""Heat kernel on hyperbolic space H^n_k.

The heat kernel `k^n_t(d)` is the fundamental solution of the heat
equation `∂_t u = Δ u` on `H^n` — the probability density of a
Brownian motion at radial distance `d` after time `t`. Unlike on
Euclidean space (where the Gaussian formula is the same for all n),
hyperbolic heat kernels depend on dimension through formulas that
**alternate between odd and even n**:

  - **n = 1** (degenerate; `H^1 = R`): the standard Gaussian
    `(4πt)^{-1/2} · exp(-d²/4t)`.

  - **n = 3** (Davies–Mandouvalos 1988, closed form):

        k^3_t(d) = (4πt)^{-3/2} · exp(-t - d²/4t) · d / sinh(d).

  - **Odd n = 2m+1** (Grigor'yan–Noguchi recursion):

        k^{n+2}_t(d) = -(2π sinh d)^{-1} · ∂_d k^n_t(d),

    starting from n=1 (which recovers n=3 cleanly) or from n=3 for
    higher odd dimensions.

  - **n = 2** (Davies–Mandouvalos integral form, no elementary
    closed form):

        k^2_t(d) = (√2 · exp(-t/4) / (4πt)^{3/2}) ·
                   ∫_d^∞ s · exp(-s²/4t) / √(cosh s − cosh d)  ds.

  - **Even n = 2m**: apply the recursion `m − 1` times to n=2 (the
    seed integral) just like the odd case applies it to n=1 or n=3.

Curvature scaling: for a hyperbolic manifold of sectional curvature
`k < 0`, set `K = |k|` and the kernel rescales via

    k^n_{K, t}(d) = K^{n/2} · k^n_{1, K·t}(√K · d).

Implementation notes:
  - n ∈ {1, 2, 3} are evaluated by their dedicated routines
    (closed-form Gaussian, Gauss–Legendre quadrature, closed-form
    Davies–Mandouvalos respectively).
  - n ∈ {5, 7} have hand-derived polynomial closed forms from the
    operator chain `(1/sinh d · ∂_d)^m` (m = 2, 3) applied
    analytically — faster and more precise than the autograd
    recursion (no `torch.autograd.grad` float compounding). The n=7
    form also seeds the odd-n recursion at n ≥ 9.
  - n ≥ 9 odd, n ≥ 4 even: apply the recursion via `torch.autograd`,
    which differentiates the dimension-n-2 kernel w.r.t. `d`.
    Numerically delicate near d = 0 (the `1/sinh d` factor amplifies
    float noise); the implementation clamps the denominator at the
    dtype's smallest-positive to prevent NaN propagation but
    callers should not query the kernel exactly at d=0 for n ≥ 5
    without further regularization.

    """Heat kernel `k^n_t(d)` on the hyperbolic manifold `manifold`.

    Computes the probability density of a Brownian-motion particle at
    geodesic distance `d` after time `t`, starting from a delta source
    at the manifold origin.

    The kernel depends only on `t`, the geodesic distance `d`, and the
    intrinsic dimension `n` of the manifold (rotational symmetry
    around the source). Curvature scales out: for curvature `k = -|k|`,

        k^n_{−|k|, t}(d)  =  |k|^{n/2} · k^n_{−1, |k|·t}(√|k| · d).

    Args:
      t: positive time(s). Broadcastable with `distances`. Typically
        a scalar, but `(B,)` or matching `distances.shape` are also
        supported.
      distances: non-negative geodesic distance(s). Any shape, must
        be broadcastable with `t`.
      manifold: a manifold object exposing `.n` (intrinsic dim) and
        `.k` (sectional curvature, expected `k < 0`).
      n_quad: number of Gauss–Legendre nodes for the n=2 integral.
        Default 32; cataloged as `HEAT_KERNEL_QUADRATURE_NODES`.
      tail_budget: integration-upper-bound budget factor (truncate at
        `d + sqrt(tail_budget · t)`). Default 20. Cataloged.

    Returns:
      Tensor of heat-kernel values, same shape as
      `broadcast(t, distances)`.

    Dimension support:
      - n = 1, 2, 3: dedicated routines (closed form / integral /
        closed form).
      - n ≥ 5 odd, n ≥ 4 even: Grigor'yan–Noguchi recursion via
        `torch.autograd.grad`. Numerically reliable for n ≤ ~9 on
        float64 and `d` bounded away from 0. For `d → 0` with n ≥ 5
        the limit exists but the implementation is numerically
        ill-conditioned (`1/sinh^{n-3} d` amplifies float noise).
