"""Manifold-valued Laplacian eigenmaps via Riemannian SGD.

The Euclidean Laplacian-eigenmap embedding (Belkin–Niyogi 2003)
positions graph nodes in `R^k` by solving

    min_{Y ∈ R^{N×k}}  Σ_{i,j} A_{ij} · ‖Y_i − Y_j‖²,

a quadratic objective whose minimizer is the bottom-k eigenvectors of
the graph Laplacian (modulo a constant constraint). The natural
generalization to a Riemannian manifold replaces the Euclidean
squared distance with the manifold geodesic distance squared:

    min_{Y ∈ M^N}  Σ_{i,j} A_{ij} · d_M(Y_i, Y_j)²,

which no longer has a closed-form spectral solution but admits
Riemannian gradient descent: the Riemannian gradient of the
per-edge term `d_M(Y_i, Y_j)²` with respect to `Y_i` is
`−2 · log_{Y_i}(Y_j)` (the steepest direction to move `Y_i` toward
`Y_j`). For symmetric adjacency `A`, the total gradient on `Y_i` is

    grad_{Y_i}  =  −2 · (1 / deg(i)) · Σ_j A_{ij} · log_{Y_i}(Y_j).

The `1/deg(i)` factor is the random-walk normalization (the
gradient of the *normalized* Laplacian energy, equivalent to using
`L_rw = I − D⁻¹A`). Without it, hub nodes receive steps ~ deg(i)
times larger than leaf nodes, and dense graphs (n_edges ≳ 500)
overflow the manifold's `cosh`/`tan` factors well before
convergence. The normalized form is degree-invariant, so the same
`lr` works for graphs of any size and density.

We push this through `RiemannianSGD`, which handles the
`projection → retraction` cycle.

When `M = LorentzManifold`, the output embedding inherits hyperbolic
geometry's exponential capacity — the standard cure for high-tree-
distortion graphs that Euclidean embeddings saturate on (Sarkar
2011 distortion bound; Nickel–Kiela 2017 *Poincaré Embeddings*).

    """Embed the nodes of `adjacency` on `manifold` by minimizing

        Σ_{i,j} A_{ij} · d_M(Y_i, Y_j)²

    via Riemannian SGD.

    Args:
      adjacency: `(B, N, N)` symmetric non-negative graph adjacency
        per batch. Self-loops `A_{ii}` are tolerated (their gradient
        contribution is zero by `log_{Y_i}(Y_i) = 0`) but discouraged
        for numerical hygiene; pre-zero the diagonal if you want.
      manifold: a manifold object exposing `random_point`, `log`,
        `projection`, `retraction`, `norm` (see e.g.
        `LorentzManifold`). The embedding dimension is taken from
        `manifold.n`; output has shape `(B, N, manifold.n + 1)` for
        the Lorentz case (ambient form).
      max_steps: number of RSGD steps. Default 200 — enough for
        moderate-size graphs (N ≤ a few hundred) to reach a stable
        configuration on a Hadamard manifold; raise for harder
        objectives.
      lr: Riemannian SGD step size. Default 0.05 follows
        `torch.optim.SGD`-style empirical defaults for embedding
        problems; tune if the loss diverges (smaller) or stalls
        (larger).
      generator: optional `torch.Generator` for reproducible init.
      init: optional `(B, N, ambient_dim)` initial embedding. If
        provided, must lie on the manifold. Default: random points
        via `manifold.random_point`.

    Returns:
      `(B, N, ambient_dim)` embedding on `manifold`. For
      `LorentzManifold(n)`, `ambient_dim = n + 1`.

    Example:
      >>> from holonomy_lib.manifolds import LorentzManifold
      >>> mfd = LorentzManifold(n=2)
      >>> A = torch.eye(5).unsqueeze(0)  # trivial graph, B=1, N=5
      >>> Y = hyperbolic_laplacian_eigenmaps(A, mfd, max_steps=10)
      >>> Y.shape
      torch.Size([1, 5, 3])

    Notes:
      Per-step cost is `O(B · N² · D)` from the pairwise `log` call
      (`D = ambient_dim`). Acceptable for `N ≤ a few hundred`; larger
      graphs should chunk along the `N²` dimension or use a sparse
      adjacency-based loss (not implemented here — Stage 2 scope is
      the dense case).

      The result is **not** rotation-canonicalized (the optimal
      embedding is determined only up to isometries of the manifold);
      caller is responsible for any canonical alignment.
