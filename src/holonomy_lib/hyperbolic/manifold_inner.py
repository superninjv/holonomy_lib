"""Manifold-aware inner product — cosine-analog on a Riemannian manifold.

For points x, y on a Riemannian manifold M, the natural "inner
product" is not the ambient dot product (which ignores the geometry)
but the Riemannian inner product of their tangent representations at
a common base point. The standard construction uses the origin (or
any user-supplied base point) and pulls each point back via `log`:

    ⟨x, y⟩_M  :=  ⟨log_o(x), log_o(y)⟩_o,

where `log_o(·)` is the inverse exponential at the origin and the
right-hand inner product is the Riemannian metric `g_o` on `T_o M`.
The quantity is symmetric, bilinear in its tangent representatives,
and reduces to the standard Euclidean inner when M is Euclidean.

Manifold-agnostic: this primitive works on any manifold that exposes
`log(x, y)`, `inner(x, u, v)`, and `origin(batch_size)`. For
`LorentzManifold` the Riemannian inner at the north-pole tangent
agrees with the Euclidean inner of the spatial coordinates (the time
coordinate of the tangent is 0 at the origin). For
`KappaStereographicManifold` it carries the conformal factor
`λ_κ(o)² = 4`, so `manifold_aware_inner(x, x) = d(o, x)²` on both
manifolds — a model-invariant similarity.

    Manifold-agnostic — works on any manifold exposing `log(x, y)`,

    metric-consistent "similarity at origin" and satisfies
    `manifold_aware_inner(x, x) = d_M(o, x)²` on all manifolds.

    Args:
      x, y: points on the manifold, shape `(B, ambient_dim)`.
      manifold: a manifold object exposing `log`, `inner`, `origin`.

    Returns:
      `(B,)` tensor of Riemannian inner products.
