"""holonomy_lib.hyperbolic — manifold-aware graph operations.

The primitives in this module take a manifold (e.g.
`LorentzManifold`) as an explicit dependency and operate on points
embedded in that manifold. This is the layer where graph algorithms
meet differential geometry — Fréchet (intrinsic) means, manifold-
valued Laplacian eigenmaps, parallel-transport-based similarity,
and the manifold heat kernel.

Manifold is passed in by dependency injection so primitives
generalize to other constant-curvature manifolds
(`KappaStereographicManifold`, future spherical etc.) without
rewrites.
