"""holonomy_lib.lie — Lie group primitives for SO(3) and the 2-sphere.

The Lie group `SO(3)` is the group of orientation-preserving
rotations of R³; its Lie algebra `so(3)` is the 3-dim space of
skew-symmetric matrices (equivalently, angular-velocity vectors).
This module ships the standard exp/log/random/compose primitives
plus real spherical harmonics, which are the natural basis for any
SO(3)-equivariant function on the unit sphere.

Currently exposed:
  so3.axis_angle_to_matrix(axis, angle)  — Rodrigues formula.
  so3.matrix_to_axis_angle(R)            — inverse log map.
  so3.so3_exp(omega)                     — matrix exp on so(3).
  so3.so3_log(R)                         — matrix log on SO(3).
  so3.random_so3(batch_size, generator)  — Haar-uniform via
                                            quaternion sampling.
  so3.compose(R1, R2)                    — group product (matmul).
  real_spherical_harmonics(directions, l_max)
                                          — closed-form Y_lm for
                                            l ≤ 4 evaluated at
                                            (B, 3) unit direction
                                            vectors.

Planned (v0.2 follow-ups):
  Wigner-D matrices (real basis) for higher-l rotation actions on
    spherical-harmonic features.
  Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for SO(3) tensor products (l₁ ⊗ l₂ → L).
  SE(3), SU(2), SL(n) primitives.
