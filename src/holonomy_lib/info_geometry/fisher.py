"""Fisher information metric + natural-gradient primitives.

The Fisher information matrix is the canonical Riemannian metric on a
parametric statistical manifold:

    g_{ij}(θ) = E_{p_θ}[ (∂_i log p_θ)(∂_j log p_θ) ]
              = − E_{p_θ}[ ∂_i ∂_j log p_θ ].

It is the second-order Taylor coefficient of KL near the diagonal:

    KL(p_θ ‖ p_{θ + dθ}) = ½ dθᵀ F(θ) dθ + O(‖dθ‖³).

Information geometry studies the geodesics of this metric; in
optimization the natural gradient `F(θ)^{−1} ∇L` follows the
steepest-descent direction with respect to the same metric, which is
parameterization-invariant and a much better step for the loss
landscapes that overparameterized models induce (Amari 1998).

Two closed-form Fisher matrices are exposed for the most common
families; users with a custom likelihood can compute their own Fisher
either analytically or via `torch.autograd` over `log p`.

  fisher_information_categorical(p)
    Diagonal Fisher on the simplex, g_ii(p) = 1/p_i. Recovers the
    Hellinger-Bhattacharyya geometry whose geodesic distance is twice
    the Hellinger angle.

  fisher_information_gaussian_mean(Sigma)
    The Fisher information for the mean of N(μ, Σ) at fixed Σ. The
    closed form is g(μ) = Σ^{−1}, which makes the Fisher-metric
    geodesics between two means coincide with the Mahalanobis-distance
    straight lines for that fixed Σ.

  natural_gradient(grad, fisher_matrix)
    Apply the Fisher inverse to a Euclidean gradient via a stable
    linear solve (no explicit inverse). The output is the direction
    that minimizes the loss most efficiently in the Fisher geometry.
