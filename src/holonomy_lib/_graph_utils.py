  Self-loop policy
  ----------------
  Graph primitives in this library treat the input adjacency `A` as a
  simple graph: the diagonal `A[i, i]` is **dropped at entry**, not
  treated as an edge from node `i` to itself.

  Rationale: most of the math (Forman-Ricci, Ollivier-Ricci, the
  random-walk and symmetric-normalized Laplacians, magnetic Laplacian)
  is defined on simple graphs in the source literature. Implicitly
  including self-loops changes `d_i = Σ_j A[i, j]` and propagates into
  every downstream operation (normalizers, walk distributions, phase
  factors). Letting the caller decide silently produced
  inconsistent semantics across primitives — different ops gave
  different answers on the same input depending on whether they
  happened to cancel the diagonal.

  The combinatorial Laplacian `L = D − A` happens to be invariant to
  self-loops (the diagonal subtraction zeroes them), but we still drop
  them at entry so callers see consistent behavior across the library.

    Notes:

      compatible with `torch.vmap` / `torch.compile`. The eye tensor
      is built with `A`'s dtype to avoid implicit dtype promotion.
